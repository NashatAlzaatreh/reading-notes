## ***Lists**

### There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:

- #### Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
- #### Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
- #### Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

### Ordered Lists
#### The ordered list is created with the `<ol>` element.
#### Each item in the list is placed between an opening `<li> ` tag and a closing `</li>` tag. (The `li` stands for list item.)

### Unordered Lists
#### The unordered list is created with the `<ul>` element.
#### Each item in the list is placed between an opening  `<li>`  tag and a closing  `</li>`  tag. (The li stands for list item.)

### Definition Lists
#### The definition list is created with the  `<dl>`  element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
#### Inside the  `<dl>`  element you will usually see pairs of `<dt>`  and `<dd>` elements.
#### `<dt>`  is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
#### `<dd>` is used to contain the definition.

### Nested Lists
#### You can put a second list inside an `<li>`  element to create a sublist or nested list. 


## ***Boxes** 

### Box Dimensions
#### By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the `height` and `width` properties.

### Limiting Width
#### Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the `min-width` property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the `max-width` property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.

### Overflowing Content 
#### The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values: `hidden` or `scroll`

### Border, Margin & Padding
