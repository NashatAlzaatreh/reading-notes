# Build the Perfect Team

### What Is the Purpose of a Team?
##### A team exists to allow an endeavor to grow, scale, and thrive in a way that would be literally impossible for one person to do.

##### A successful team starts with hiring the right people—those who value working toward a common goal, are goal-oriented, and respect the hierarchical structure that most businesses require.

##### Once the right people are in place, the goal is to bring them together into a cohesive unit.

### Why Is It Important to Build a Strong Team?

##### Even the most innovative entrepreneurs cannot scale from an idea to actualized success without the help of a team. There’s simply too much work for one person to do alone. As good as a business idea might be, it cannot be a proper business without a dynamic team working cohesively to execute a shared business plan.
##### The business team you assemble should contain complementary skill sets such that the full group of people can accomplish tasks that you, as the team leader, could not do on your own. And consider your competition: your rival isn’t going to be one person. It’s going to be a fully realized company with its own corporate structure, its own company culture, and its own unique group of individuals who themselves bring years of experience.

### How to Build a Strong Team

##### 1- Establish expectations from day one.
##### 2- Respect your team members as individuals.
##### 3- Engender connections within the team. 
##### 4- Motivate with positivity. 
##### 5- Look for ways to reward good work
##### 6- Find a team you trust.
