### Images 

#### Controlling sizes of Images in CSS 
##### You can control the size of an image using the `width` and `height` properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.

#### Centering images Using CSS

##### By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text.
##### In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display property with a value of block.
##### Once it has been made into a block-level element, there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:
##### 1: On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.
##### 2: On the image itself, you can use  the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.
##### You can specify class names that allow any element to be centered, in the same way that you can for the dimensions or alignment of images.


##### You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site.
##### Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.
##### You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page.
#####  Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.
##### You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
#####  To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites. 

### Practical Information 

#### Search engine optimization helps visitors find your sites when using search engines.
##### Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.
#### To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.
#### FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.
##### Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).


### Video and Audio APIs
#### The `<video>` and `<audio>` elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages. As we showed

#### The HTMLMediaElement API
##### Part of the HTML5 spec, the `HTMLMediaElement` API provides features to allow you to control video and audio players programmatically â€” for example `HTMLMediaElement.play()`, `HTMLMediaElement.pause()`, etc. This interface is available to both `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, as the features you'll want to implement are nearly identical.
