## Solving Problems

### How to Solve Programming Problems

#### 1- Read the problem completely twice.

#### 2- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

#### 3- Optimize the manual steps.

#### 4- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

#### 5- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

#### 6- Optimize the real code.

#### - As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.

## Act like you make $1000/hr

### what if you placed a high value on your time?

#### “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness

#### “Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss

#### It takes discipline to not become “busy.”

#### If you let it, your world and the people around you will take all your time. Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month.

#### This is how lives are wasted — by doing thankless work for ungrateful takers that didn’t deserve your time in the first place.

#### We’re all busy — with work, our families, our friends. It’s not bad to be “busy.” But in the words of best-selling author Jeff Goins

#### “Living in frenzy is a sign we’ve squandered too much.” -Niklas Goke

#### In reality, a lot of people are living a frenzied, busy life. They wear their business as a badge of honor, and brag about their full schedules.

#### Frankly, most people prefer the little dopamine boost of checking boxes on a to-do list than actually getting important work done.

### How do you value your time?

#### Take stock of the things you did this week. How many of them were worthy of $1,000/hour?

#### How many activities were a true waste of time?

#### Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.

## How to think like a programmer

#### “Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs

### what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

### 1. Understand

#### Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them .

#### How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.

#### Do you remember being stuck on a problem, you start explaining it, and you instantly see holes in the logic you didn’t see before?

#### Most programmers know this feeling.

### 2. Plan

#### Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

#### Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.

#### In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

#### To get a good plan, answer this question:

#### “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”

### 3. Divide

#### Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.

#### Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

#### Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

#### Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

#### After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.

#### Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.

#### Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!

#### This technique is a cornerstone of problem-solving.

### 4. Stuck?

#### By now, you’re probably sitting there thinking “Hey Richard... That’s cool and all, but what if I’m stuck and can’t even solve a sub-problem??”

#### First off, take a deep breath. Second, that’s fair.

#### Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!

#### The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.

#### In fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:

#### Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).

#### Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?

#### The classic example of this, of course, is the summation of a long list of consecutive integers, 1 + 2 + 3 + … + n, which a very young Gauss quickly recognized was simply n(n+1)/2, thus avoiding the effort of having to do the addition.” — C. Jordan Ball

#### Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).

#### Caveat: Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.

## The 5 Whys

### How to Use the 5 Whys

#### The model follows a very simple seven-step process:

### 1. Assemble a Team

#### Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

### 2. Define the Problem

#### If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. For example, "Team A isn't meeting its response time targets" or "Software release B resulted in too many rollback failures."

#### Then, write your statement on a whiteboard or sticky note, leaving enough space around it to add your answers to the repeated question, "Why?"

### 3. Ask the First "Why?"

#### Ask your team why the problem is occurring. (For example, "Why isn't Team A meeting its response time targets?")

#### Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.

### 4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times

#### For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.

### 5. Know When to Stop

#### You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident.

### 6. Address the Root Cause(s)

#### Now that you've identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.

### 7. Monitor Your Measures

#### Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely. If this happens, it's a good idea to repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.
