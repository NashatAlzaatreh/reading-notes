# Authentication

#### 1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)

A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance. It contains static variables that can accommodate unique and private instances of itself.

#### 2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes

To create the singleton class, we need to have static member of class, private constructor and static factory method.

- Static member: It gets memory only once because of static, it contains the instance of the Singleton class.

- Private constructor: It will prevent to instantiate the Singleton class from outside the class.

- Static factory method: This provides the global point of access to the Singleton object and returns the instance to the caller.

### Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be. Authentication in the context of web applications is commonly performed by submitting a username or ID and one or more items of private information that only a given user should know.

#### Session Management

is a process by which a server maintains the state of an entity interacting with it. This is required for a server to remember how to react to subsequent requests throughout a transaction. Sessions are maintained on the server by a session identifier which can be passed back and forward between the client and server when transmitting and receiving requests.

### Securing Passwords with Bcrypt Hashing Function

Cryptographic hash algorithms MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SHA-3 are general purpose hash functions, designed to calculate a digest of huge amounts of data in as short a time as possible. Hashing is the greatest way for protecting passwords and considered to be pretty safe for ensuring the integrity of data or password.

The benefit of hashing is that if someone steals the database with hashed passwords, they only make off with the hashes and not the actual plaintext passwords. But why do we always hear about passwords being cracked? There are some weaknesses in cryptographic hash algorithm that allows an attacker to calculate the original value of a hashed password

### PROBLEMS WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH ALGORITHM

- Brute Force attack: Hashes can't be reversed, so instead of reversing the hash of the password, an attacker can simply keep trying different inputs until he does not find the right now that generates the same hash value, called brute force attack.

- Hash Collision attack: Hash functions have infinite input length and a predefined output length, so there is inevitably going to be the possibility of two different inputs that produce the same output hash. MD5, SHA1, SHA2 are vulnerable to Hash Collision Attack i.e. two input strings of a hash function that produce the same hash result.
