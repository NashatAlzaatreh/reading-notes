#### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

identify the errors, consider what do you want from the code, andTDD creates code that is maintainable, flexible, and easily extensible.

#### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

They are jest helper functions to handle the repeated runs of a piece of code before/after each test run. So when you have multiple tests that require doing some work before/after each test run, write the code inside them.

#### What is one downside of Test Driven Development

The downside to TDD is that it is usually tightly associated with 'Agile' methodology, which places no importance on documentation of a system, rather the understanding behind why a test 'should' return one specific value rather than any other resides only in the developer's head.

#### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

A child of an ES6 class is another type definition which extends the parent with new properties and methods, which in turn can be instantiated at runtime.A class constructor creates an instance of the class. A constructor in JavaScript is just a plain old function that returns an object.

#### Why REST?

One of the key advantages of REST APIs is that they provide a great deal of flexibility. Data is not tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia. This flexibility allows developers to build an API that meets your needs while also meeting the needs of very diverse customers.

#### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- functional programming: a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects

- object-oriented programming (OOP): It is the ability of creating different objects from a common object.
- class: blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data and functions that manipulate data.

- super: keyword is used to access and call functions on an object’s parent.

- this: a keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used.

- Test Driven Development (TDD): a software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do.
- Jest: a JavaScript testing framework used for creating, running, and structuring tests.

- Continuous Integration (CI): the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.
- REST: an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.
