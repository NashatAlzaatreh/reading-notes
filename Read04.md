# JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?
#### ***JavaScript*** (often shortened to ***JS***) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.


## JavaScript Display Possibilities: 
### JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

- ####  Writing into an HTML element, using ` innerHTML`.
- #### Writing into the HTML output using ` document.write()`.
- #### Writing into an alert box, using ` window.alert()`.
- #### Writing into the browser console, using ` console.log()`.

## JavaScript Variables
### JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
#### In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:

```md
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
```
#### From the example above, you can expect:

- x stores the value 5
- y stores the value 6
- z stores the value 11


## JavaScript Identifiers 
#### All JavaScript ***variables*** must be ***identified*** with unique names.
#### These unique names are called ***identifiers***.

#### Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

#### The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- #### Names must begin with a letter
- #### Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
- #### Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
- #### Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
