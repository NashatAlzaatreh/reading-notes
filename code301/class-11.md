### Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases

![SQL vs NoSQL](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ashfaq-Shaikh-2/publication/328093939/figure/tbl2/AS:678268403470341@1538723197929/Comparison-between-SQL-and-NoSQL.png)

### - What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

#### The complex query intensive environmentand heavy duty transactional type applications, as it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the dat

### - What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

#### The hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data, Semi-structured or Unstructured data / flexible schema, Limited pre-defined access paths and query patterns, No complex queries, stored procedures, or views, andHigh velocity transactions

### - Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

#### NoSQL

### - Which type of database is best for scalability?

#### SQL

### - What does SQL stand for?

#### Structured Query Language

### - What is a realational database?

#### A type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

### - What type of structure does a relational database work with?

#### The logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are separate from the physical storage structures. This separation means that database administrators can manage physical data storage without affecting access to that data as a logical structure.

### - What is a ‘schema’?

#### A database schema it is a structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system. The term “schema” refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed

### - What is a NoSQL database?

#### NoSQL databases (aka “not only SQL”) are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

### - What is inside of a Mongo database?

#### Records which are made up of documents that contain a data structure composed of field and value pairs.

### - Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

#### While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions

### - What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

#### NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have.
