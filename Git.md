# what is git ? 

#### Git is the most commonly used version control system ***(VCS)***. Git ***tracks*** the changes you make to files, so you have a ***record*** of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes ***collaboration*** easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.

#### For ***example***, when you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, and why.
